## Project Introduction
This project looks to investigate the data around NFL super bowl winning rosters, to see what possible trends exist between these rosters, and how one might draw insights when wanting to build a roster that has a higher likelihood of winning/appearing in a super bowl. 

This exploratory analysis is then followed by a logistical regression model for predicting super bowl winners and super bowl appearance teams based on regular season statistics. This prediction model predicts whether an NFL offense will appear and/or win a super bowl based on their regular season statistics, and then the same for the defense of a given team, based on aggregated data from 2017-2022. 

### Sources:
The data in this project has been retrieved from pro-football-reference.com, for both NFL and College Football data.
